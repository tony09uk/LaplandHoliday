                                <p>Your first thing to decide on is your budget, prices can start around £40 per night and they go up from there.</p>
                                <p>Next you need to decide on where you want to stay. This decision may be driven by ease of travel, proxmity to some attraction 
                                    that you are particuly interested in  - <a href="file:///D:/Dev/Web/LaplandHoliday/things-to-do.html">Check out things to do in rovaniemi</a> - 
                                    or you may want to stay away from the city, increasing your chances of seeing the Northern lights on you doorstep.</p>
                                <p>We stayed at an AirBnB, which was absolutly fantistic! Although we booked in the January to stay in the Decemeber, a lot of Accomodation
                                    had already been snapped up. So book as far in advance as you can. Many places allow you to book and cancel up to 48 hrs prior to arrival.</p>
                                <p>With this cancellation policy it makes sense - to me - to book your accomodation and simply wait for the flights to be released</p>

                                <p>We all want to get low priced flights to get to get to Lapland and there are a few tips you can try to help you achieve that, but remember 
                                to account for additional baggage cost and with some airlines you may need to book a seat when travelling with young children.</p>
                                <p>To get the best price you will have to activly monitor to the market. When we travelled any price under £130 turned out to be a very good price
                                for a direct flight in to rovaniemi. We paid about £120 per person to fly direct each way (including the extras that RyanAir flight incure). So 
                                consider a price you will be willing to pay for a direct flight with no transfers. Now you can consider if you are willing to accept a transfer 
                                or if you are willing to fly in to Helsinki and catch the overnight Santa train to Rovaniemi, each option should reduce your cost - but not always.
                                We activly avoided any flights with transfers due to the increased risk of the flights not connecting or the increased liklyhood of
                                lost baggage!</p>
                                <p>If you are anything like us you will be consistanly looking for flights from the moment you book, but it's worth noting that although there 
                                    are some available they are not always a great deal or - as we found - have a higher likelihood of being cacelled (it happend to us twice).
                                    Pay attention to the Forums and there will be a lot activity from people on the lead up to flight realease dates offering ideas of up to date
                                    prices you should expect to pay. This usually happens mid-year (June or July ish).</p>
                                <p>I used many different website to try and find the best deals but the two best I found was <a href="www.skyscanner.net">Skyscanner</a> and <a href="www.kayak.co.uk">Kayak</a>
                                Sign yourself up to their news letter - you can always cancel it when you have got your flight</p>
                                <p>If you decide to fly to Helsinki you may save some money, we were finding flights for approxmatly £50 per person each way. Remember also allow
                                    for the cost of the train and decide if you want to spend some of your holiday on a train (some of those who have done have said it was an excellent experience).
                                    We decided against as it would eat in to our time at Rovaniemi, but it certainly shouldn't be dismissed. Especially when children can travel free if you 
                                    are willing to share a bed with them.

                                <h6 class="f_p f_600 f_size_18 t_color3">Airport Parking</h6>
                                <p>Airport parking costs can oftern be overlooked when budgeting for your trip and at up tp £150 for one week, it's worth considering and looking for cheaper 
                                    alternatives or at the very least factoring it in.</p>
                                <p>For most travelling to Lapland parking may be the cheapest option, but see if you can get a bus, train or have a friend give you a lift.</p>
                                <p>There is a great article on this subject from <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/travel/cheap-airport-parking/">MoneySavingExpert.com</a>
                                </p>
                                <h6 class="f_p f_600 f_size_18 t_color3">Pre/Post Hotel flight</h6>
                                <p>Depending on your flight time you and how far away you live you may need/want to consider saying over closer to the airport the night before. If you 
                                    are fliying from Stansted then you will be looking at around £80 for this little luxury. We choose this option on return, however the rest of our party
                                    opted to drive home immidatly. It depends on what you prefer, but don't overlook this option.</p>
                                <h6 class="f_p f_600 f_size_18 t_color3">Passport</h6>
                                <p>You may have your flights and accomodation to Rovaniemi booked, but hav eyou double checked you Passwort? Make sure it has at least 3 months left on it from the 
                                    day you plan to leave the country.</p>
                                <p>If you find that you do not have the required time left on your passport you can use one of two services.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-a-passport-urgently/online-premium-service">Online Premium service</a></li>
                                        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-a-passport-urgently/1-week-fast-track-service">1 week Fast Track service</a></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    The above services seem to be very efficent and I've heard the "1 week Fast Track service" arriving in a couple of days. But hopefully you wont have this panic.
                                </p>
                                <h6 class="f_p f_600 f_size_18 t_color3">Insurance</h6>
                                <p>Insurance is a MUST, but check that you are covered for any activities that yo plan on doing. Winter holiday cover will not always cover it. This doesn't mean 
                                    read through all the small print (although I would reccomend it, make sure you know what you are getting). For our travel insurance we used <a href="https://www.snowcard.co.uk/">Snowcard.co.uk</a>
                                    I found their cover to provide everything we needed, including Husky and Snow mobile rides.
                                </p>
                                <h6 class="f_p f_600 f_size_18 t_color3">Airport transfer</h6>
                                <p>If you are staying anywhere in Rovaniemi you will be able to grab a Taxi or public transport to get to your accomodation. It is only 6 miles from the city 
                                    center and if you stay at the Santa village, walking would be an option. Rovaniemi airport small so you dont have far to go to find Taxi's or the bus to a the 
                                    city center - step out the exit and they are right in front of you.
                                </p>
                                <p>If you want to get a Taxi you will be looking to pay around €1.40 + €0.80 per minuet for car of 1-4 people and around €1.96 + €0.80 per minuet for car of 5-8. A 30 minuet lift
                                    cost use €48.00 <a href="https://www.rovaniemenaluetaksi.fi/eng/pricing">Source</a></p>
                                <p>The taxi company we used was called <a href="https://meneva.fi/en/service-areas/lapland/rovaniemi">"Meneva"</a> and they provided an app which made life very easy for us - 
                                    (until we were able to collect our hire cars)</p>
                                <h6 class="f_p f_600 f_size_18 t_color3">Car hire</h6>
                                <p>Hiring a car can open up many options for your holiday. We choose to hire because we were staying so far out of town, but there are many other reasons to hire a car 
                                    while at Rovaniemi. But it depends on what activites you plan ondoing, where you stay and how much free time you will have. If you do hire a car see the below gotcha.
                                </p>
                                <p><u>!!!CREDIT CARD GOTCHA!!!:</u> Make sure you have a credit in the NAME OF THE MAIN DRIVER - NOT A DEBIT CARD! I labour this point as I had read the website and contacted 
                                the customer care helpline to confirm that a debitcard would be okay. Both sources stated it was! On pickup the I was told a credit card in the name of the main driver is 
                                the only thing they can take. We were lucky and the company transfered the main driver to one of our group, but I've heard stories of people having to rebook the car at 
                                a hugh cost to them.</p>
                                <p>If you are arriving on a late flight its worth checking with the company that they will wait for late flights...ours did not! Checking in maybe required to cofirm that you are 
                                    on your way. Try and have a back up plan incase they are not there for any reason.
                                </p>

                                <p>What activities do you want to do and what is your budget? There are a whole range of things to be done, but it depends on your interests. Do you want an 
                                    exlirating ride across a frozen lake on Huskies or speed through the forest on a snow-mobile, or would your prefer your lapland holiday to be a more relaxing, 
                                    by floating in a lake and watching the night sky? There is so much to choose from.

                                <h6 class="f_p f_600 f_size_18 t_color3">Clothing</h6>
                                <p>One of the biggest talking points on any forum is what clothing should you take and how much, is the snow wet or dry? How do all these things affect my decisions on what to buy 
                                    and can I get away with budget clothing or will it leave me feeling cold. With just a little knowledge you will feel more confident in you decision on what to take on your holiday 
                                    to Lapland.
